Updates to work with Sublime Text 3.1.

Due to changes in the underlying build system, which this leverages,
this build is incompatible with versions before 3.1.

With ST 3.1, the build system code was refactored. This package
relied on some of the details of that package, and since they no
longer existed, this package broke.
